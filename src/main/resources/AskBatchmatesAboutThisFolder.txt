Ask your batch-mates what is supposed to go into the Resources Folder. This folder is empty in Tim's Demo.

Here's what I will be putting in my Resources Folder:

1. This file, where I write my notes.
2. My log4j.properties file.
3. My User.hbm.xml file <----- NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
4. My hibernate.cfg.xml file <----- NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
